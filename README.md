Reduce emissions, have a blast! There exists a gap between consumer knowledge and the reality of how affordable electric cars can be. It costs much less to run an electric car than a gas-powered vehicle. Our team wanted to show the user exactly what impact they could have on their budget and in their community. This app accomplishes all that and more!
